# Porting a WPF app to Linux with .NET Core and Wine

## Overview

With the release of .NET Core 3.0 and it's support for WPF it is now possible to run a WPF app Linux by running the application under Wine.

For those who have not heard of Wine before, it is a compatibiliy layer which allows you to run Windows applications of Linux, and other OSes.
For more information you can read up on Wine at their website: [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/)

Wine, in my experience, is mostly used to enable users to run games on Linux, which is great for the WPF use case since WPF uses DirectX for rendering.
